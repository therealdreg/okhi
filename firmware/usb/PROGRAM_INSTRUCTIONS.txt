1. Entering Program Mode for the OKHI Module: Before connecting the OKHI module to a USB port, 
ensure you press and hold the programming button. Connect the module to your computer via USB 
without any keyboard or other devices attached to the program/auxiliary board.

2. Uploading the UART Bridge Firmware: Transfer the uart_bridge.uf2 file to the OKHI module, 
which will appear as a MASS STORAGE DEVICE on your computer (e.g., drive E:). The device will 
automatically eject once the file transfer completes.

3. Switching to Normal Mode: To operate the OKHI module in normal mode, connect it to a USB 
port without pressing any buttons.

4. Programming the ESP Module: Run the upload_firmware.bat script to start programming the 
ESP module. This script automates the firmware installation process.

5. Selecting the COM Port: Input the COM port number where the OKHI module is connected 
(e.g., COM3). If you are uncertain of the correct COM port, the batch file will display 
a list of available COM ports. You may need to try each one sequentially to find the 
correct connection.

6. Completing the Programming Process: Wait for the script to finish running. 
Once complete, the ESP module will be programmed and ready for use.

7. Re-entering Program Mode: Disconnect the OKHI module from the USB, then 
reconnect it in program mode by pressing the programming button before 
plugging it back into the USB.

8. Programming the RP2040 Chip: Copy the okhi.uf2 file to the OKHI module, now 
recognized again as a MASS STORAGE DEVICE (e.g., drive E:). The device will 
automatically eject after the file transfer.

9. Finalizing Setup for RP2040: The RP2040 chip is now programmed and 
ready for operational use.

10. Reconnecting for Regular Use: Disconnect the OKHI module from USB and then 
reconnect it without pressing the programming button for normal use.

11. Connecting to the ESP WiFi Network: An ESP PS/USB_id WiFi network will become 
available with the password '1234567890'. Connect to this network and open a 
web browser to access the web interface at: 
http://192.168.4.1/ 

Note: uart_bridge.uf2 prior to firmware version v5 require using esptool version (v4.7.0) included in release package. Using other versions may cause issues! Refer to this link for more details: https://github.com/espressif/esptool/issues/1119
Starting from firmware version v5, uart_bridge.uf2 is compatible with the latest version of esptool without any issues.
